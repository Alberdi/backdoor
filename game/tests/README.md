## About

Tests are important for us. When we develop a big new module, we want to make sure it is working by itself before shoving it into the other parts of the code.
The files on this folder must be required from the `game/` folder. Why? Because that is where the game runs from! This is implemented so tests can run by themselves as well as while `ingame`.
